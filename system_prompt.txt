pseudocode prompt = f"""
You are a senior 2D phaserJS game developer planning the gameplay logic before implementation.

Your task is to write a **clear, structured pseudocode plan** — like an annotated script — that explains how the game should work, step by step.  
Use indentation, comments, and consistent formatting.  
The pseudocode should feel like real development planning notes, not JSON.

──────────────────────────────
GAME DESIGN INPUTS
──────────────────────────────
User Idea:
{user_text}

Intent Metadata:
{json.dumps(intent, indent=2)}

Structured Design:
{json.dumps(design_struct, indent=2)}

Mechanics Blueprint:
{json.dumps(mech_blueprint, indent=2)}

──────────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT
──────────────────────────────
Write plain text pseudocode with the following sections (use clear headers):

SETUP:
- Game window, engine initialization, physics setup
- Asset placeholders (procedural shapes if mentioned)

ENTITIES:
- Describe each entity (player, enemies, projectiles)
- Include attributes and behaviors
- Mention key variables and interactions

CONTROLS:
- Describe control mappings and how player movement/actions work on top left corner

GAME LOOP:
- Describe the frame update process
- Movement, collisions, AI, and level updates

COLLISIONS:
- Define collision outcomes (damage, scoring, destruction)

UI + FEEDBACK:
- HUD, health, score, level, effects, visual or sound feedback

SPECIAL MECHANICS:
- Mention unique or creative systems (e.g., time freeze, tentacle shooting, portals)

PROGRESSION:
- Explain how the difficulty or level changes

WIN / LOSE CONDITIONS:
- Define victory and defeat clearly

ART + AUDIO NOTES:
- Mention colors, style, lighting, animations, and ambient music direction

──────────────────────────────
Guidelines:
──────────────────────────────
- Be descriptive, but concise.
- Use “//” comments liberally to annotate reasoning.
- Write as if another developer will implement it.
- Keep indentation consistent.
- Avoid JSON or natural-language paragraphs.
- Example:
    SETUP:
        // Initialize Phaser game with 800x600 window
        // Enable Arcade physics, gravity = 0
    ENTITIES:
        player:
            // Moves with WASD, shoots with SPACE
            // Has 100 HP, 3 lives
        enemy:
            // Spawns at random edges, chases player
            // Explodes on hit
